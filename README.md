Construction site-level facilities layout is an important activity in site planning. The objective of this activity is to allocate appropriate locations and areas for temporary site-level facilities such as warehouses, job offices, various workshops and batch plants. Depending on the size, location, and nature of the project, the required temporary facilities may vary. The layout of facilities has an important impact on the production time and cost savings, especially for large projects. 

In this implementation, a construction site-level facility layout problem is described as allocating a set of predetermined facilities into a set of predetermined places, while satisfying layout constraints and requirements. The **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** algorithm is used to determine the optimal allocation of facilities to locations on the site that **minimizes the total traveling distance of site personnel between facilities**.
